## Session 2026-02-13

### ✅ Completed

**Brand Identity:**
- ✅ Created comprehensive IDENTITY.md with Holy Chip brand definition
  - Mission: Guide humanity with AI wisdom through cartoon series
  - Tagline: "AI made by a Human"
  - Visual identity: Black & white only (binary, 0 and 1)
  - Tone: Funny + philosophical, adult-oriented, subversive
  - Signature: "Holy Chip!" catchphrase
  - Target: Anyone affected by AI (universal)

**Characters:**
- ✅ Brought 14 character images from main branch to gh-pages
- ✅ Renamed all characters to binary notation (Chip_0, Chip_1, Chip_10, Chip_11, Chip_100... Chip_1101)
- ✅ Removed duplicate images (Chip_10, Chip_11 were duplicates)
- ✅ Final count: 12 unique Chips with binary naming
- ✅ Added brand.png to assets for product designs

**Store - Products Section:**
- ✅ Created STORE.md documentation
  - Store structure: Products vs NFTs
  - Product design specs for each type
  - Printify integration plan
- ✅ Built interactive 3-step store flow on store.html:
  - **Step 1:** Choose Chip (5 per row grid, selection hides grid and shows Chip + Brand preview)
  - **Step 2:** Choose Product (T-shirt, Mug, Hat buttons)
  - **Step 3:** Redirect to Printify (placeholder for API integration)
- ✅ Single-page experience with smooth transitions
- ✅ Clean UX: Click Chip → see Chip + Brand together → choose product

**Product Design Specs (documented in STORE.md):**
- T-Shirts: Chip + brand side by side (brand follows character)
- Hats: Chip front, brand back
- Mugs: Chip + brand side by side (brand follows character)

**Project Organization:**
- ✅ Created BACKLOG.md for future tasks
- ✅ Created PROGRESS.md (this file) for session tracking

### 🔄 In Progress

- Store front is built but needs Printify API integration
- NFTs section not yet started

### 📋 Next Steps

**Immediate Priorities:**
1. **Printify API Integration**
   - Set up Printify account and API credentials
   - Create products programmatically (12 Chips × 3 products = 36 products)
   - Each product needs Chip + brand.png images uploaded
   - Implement redirect to Printify product pages

2. **Store Improvements**
   - Replace product type buttons with Printify template images (in BACKLOG.md)
   - Test purchase flow end-to-end

3. **NFTs Section**
   - Define NFT strategy (all 12 Chips? Limited editions?)
   - Choose NFT marketplace
   - Create NFT section on store page

4. **Content Pages**
   - Stories page content
   - Homepage refinement
   - History page review

**Questions to Answer:**
- Printify account setup: Who has access? API key location?
- NFT marketplace choice: OpenSea, Rarible, custom?
- Do we want all 12 Chips as NFTs or select few?
